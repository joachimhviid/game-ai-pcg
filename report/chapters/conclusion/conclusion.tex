\section{Conclusions}

Your final considerations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Very shortly, what did you find out?
	\item What can this be used for? Here you want to revisit the problem domain you described in the introduction and tell us how your results fit in.
	\item What would be the next step in this avenue of research (if any)?
\end{itemize}
