\section{Literature review}

The purpose of this section is to summarize previous work in the area you are working on and describe key theories and techniques that you are going to use.
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the main theories and techniques that relate to your project? Have one or two paragraph for each, giving a summary of what they are and how they relate to your project. For example, these could be a theory that you use for the design of your project (e.g., gamification concepts), theories/methods that you use in the implementation (e.g., some AI technique), or theories/methods that you use in the evaluation of your project (e.g., flow theory, methods of user testing like A/B testing).
	\item Summary of existing studies and research on the topic. What has been done before? What other work relates to yours and how. For example: “Woodstock et al. developed a game built around algebra concepts \cite{woodstock2018} but haven’t provided a study to evaluate the efficacy of the game in a learning context”.
