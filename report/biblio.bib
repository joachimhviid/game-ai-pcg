abstract = {Abstract Although game-based learning has been increasingly promoted in education, there is a need to adapt game content to individual needs for personalized learning. Procedural content generation (PCG) offers a solution for difficulty in developing game contents automatically by algorithmic means as it can generate individually customizable game contents applicable to various objectives. In this paper, we advanced a data-driven PCG approach benefiting from a genetic algorithm and support vector machines to automatically generate educational-game contents tailored to individuals' abilities. In contrast to other content generation approaches, the proposed method is not dependent on designer's intuition in applying game contents to fit a player's abilities. We assessed this data-driven PCG approach at length and showed its effectiveness by conducting an empirical study of children who played an educational language-learning game to cultivate early English-reading skills. To affirm the efficacy of our proposed method, we evaluated the data-driven approach against a heuristic-based approach. Our results clearly demonstrated two things. First, users realized greater performance gains from playing contents tailored to their abilities compared with playing uncustomized game contents. Second, this data-driven approach was more effective in generating contents closely matching a specific player-performance target than the heuristic-based approach.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation in video games has a long history. Existing procedural content generation methods, such as search-based, solver-based, rule-based and grammar-based methods have been applied to various content types such as levels, maps, character models, and textures. A research field centered on content generation in games has existed for more than a decade. More recently, deep learning has powered a remarkable range of inventions in content production, which are applicable to games. While some cutting-edge deep learning methods are applied on their own, others are applied in combination with more traditional methods, or in an interactive setting. This article surveys the various deep learning methods that have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, discusses deep learning methods that could be used for content generation purposes but are rarely used today, and envisages some limitations and potential future directions of deep learning for procedural content generation.

@article{PCG_ML,
abstract = {This survey explores procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML), defined as the generation of game content using machine learning models trained on existing content. As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content, such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content, such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, cocreativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks: long short-term memory networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models: <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">n</tex-math></inline-formula>-grams and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in PCGML, including learning from small data sets, lack of training data, multilayered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.},

@article{Experience_Driven_PCG,
abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) is an increasingly important area of technology within modern human-computer interaction (HCI) design. Personalization of user experience via affective and cognitive modeling, coupled with real-time adjustment of the content according to user needs and preferences are important steps toward effective and meaningful PCG. Games, Web 2.0, interface, and software design are among the most popular applications of automated content generation. The paper provides a taxonomy of PCG algorithms and introduces a framework for PCG driven by computational models of user experience. This approach, which we call Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation (EDPCG), is generic and applicable to various subareas of HCI. We employ games as an example indicative of rich HCI and complex affect elicitation, and demonstrate the approach's effectiveness via dissimilar successful studies.},

@misc{Constructive_PCG,
abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) is of great interest to game design and development because it generates game content automatically. Among many serious challenges in PCG, the content quality improvement, controllability and dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) of game content in real time are three major issues in non-adaptive and adaptive content generation. Motivated by the recent learning-based PCG framework and existing PCG works, we present novel online game content generation and real-time DDA approaches to seamlessly address these issues. In this thesis, we employ learning-based methods to produce quality yet controllable game segments called constructive primitives (CPs). As a result, a complete quality game level can be generated online by integrating relevant CPs via controllable parameters regarding geometrical features and procedure-level properties. By means of CPs, we also propose a DDA algorithm that controls a CP-based level generator to rapidly adjust the content difficulty based on players' real-time game-playing performance. For a proof of concept, we apply our approach to platform and first-person shooter (FPS) games. Extensive experimental results suggest that our approach efficiently produces controllable yet quality game content in terms of a number of generic quality measurements and adaptable content for DDA in real time as shown in extensive simulations and a user study.},
